                        <p class="card-text">Air travel has seen many transformations over the decades. From the rise of
                            in-flight entertainment, to heightened security measures from the effects of the 11
                            September 2001 attacks to the popularity of long-haul flights, these are some of the dynamic
                            changes that the air travel industry faced, partly because of the changing passengers’
                            needs. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is of no difference. It has changed the passengers’
                            preference to flight experiences, with a much significant emphasis on health and safety. [1]
                            This paradigm shift not only underscores the adaptability of the aviation industry but also
                            raises questions about the future of travel in a world forever altered by the pandemic.</p>

                            The motivation behind this research endeavour lies in the profound impact that evolving
                            passenger
                            preferences have on the air travel industry and, ultimately, on the travel experiences of
                            millions
                            worldwide. With each passing year, the industry witnesses shift in priorities, influenced by
                            factors
                            ranging from technological advancements to global events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            Understanding
                            these shifts is vital for airlines, airports, and travellers alike. For airlines and
                            airports, it
                            means aligning their services and offerings with the evolving needs of their clientele. For
                            travellers, it means making informed decisions that prioritize their safety, comfort, and
                            overall
                            satisfaction.

                    <div class="card card-body">

                        We can see that majority of the passengers are generally within the age range of 20 to 59, with
                        a
                        minority under 20 and above 60. Analysing this data further, we can also see that flight economy
                        class takes up majority of the travel for passengers below the age of 30. However, for
                        passengers aged 30 to 59, we can observe a sharp increase in the portion of business to economy
                        flights taken.
                        <br><br>
                        We conducted a more in-depth analysis using the comparative method to get better insights on
                        more specific information from the previous side-by-side bar chart. In this analysis, we
                        displayed two pie charts side by side. When we compare the distribution of flight classes among
                        individuals aged 20-29 and those aged 40-49, a substantial disparity in the preference for
                        Business class over Economy class becomes evident. Among travelers in the 20-29 age group,
                        merely 40% of them opt for Business class flights. This percentage significantly rises to 61%
                        for passengers in the 40-49 age group who choose Business class flights.

                                We observe a gradual upsurge in the number of flights taken from February to May,
                                followed by a notable spike in June and July. This surge could potentially be linked to
                                events such as the summer holidays, during which families tend to embark on overseas
                                trips together.
                                <br><br>
                                There is a significant decrease in the number of travelers from 2019 to 2020, observable
                                across all months. This decline can likely be attributed to the
                                onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Furthermore, we note that the passenger travel
                                pattern for a specific month remains largely consistent over multiple years (can be
                                observed using the Viz in Tooltip).
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout the year, traveler numbers follow a consistent order, with 'Solo Leisure'
                                travelers as the most frequent, followed by 'Couple Leisure' and 'Family Leisure'
                                travelers, while 'Business' travelers are the least common. However, an
                                unusual increase in the number of 'Family Leisure' travelers occurs in June and July,
                                surpassing even the 'Couple Leisure' category during this specific period. This
                                deviation aligns with our previous onservation, suggesting that the surge in travel
                                during June
                                and July may be influenced by events like summer holidays, leading families to travel
                                abroad together.

                    An interactive dashboard is used to summarise the findings of passengers’ satisfaction when flying.
                    A pie chart matrix showing passengers’ satisfactory level against flight distance category and seat
                    class was used to depict the satisfactory level of passengers in the various groups. This will help
                    viewer to conduct targeted analysis and improvement to airline service based on passengers’ segment.
                    <br><br>

                    Additionally, airlines may also choose to make improvements to satisfactory level of passengers
                    based on their age group. This equally important as the needs and wants may differ from different
                    age group.
                    <br><br>

                    All these come in support with the histogram of Pre-Flight and On-Board services, to identify broad
                    areas where airlines can improve their services in to meet customers’ demands.
                    <br><br>

                    All these charts are interactive and work hand-in-hand with each other, to provide viewers a
                    drilled-down and targeted approach in areas for improvement.

                    <p>In this chart, a discernible global trend among passengers highlights a clear preference for
                        destinations in North America or Asia.
                        Notably, North America takes the lead with the highest number of diverse flight statuses,
                        closely followed by Asia.
                        Surprisingly, Oceania emerges as the third most favoured destination, presenting a
                        noteworthy
                        pattern ahead of Europe.
                        Meanwhile, Africa and South America exhibit comparable performance across various flight
                        statuses, securing their positions towards the end of the list.
                        An intriguing observation is the relatively even distribution of flight statuses within each
                        continent, emphasising the diverse choices available to travellers across the world.
                        With that, our team has decided to dive deeper to explore the flight delays in the United

                <p>The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of airline performance, flight delays across U.S.
                    states, and temporal trends. In terms of airline performance, Southwest Airlines Co. leads with
                    a
                    significant 15.92% of the total flight delay count, followed closely by American Airlines Inc.
                    and
                    Delta Air Lines Inc. The flight delays across U.S. states reveal substantial variations, with
                    Texas
                    experiencing the highest delays at 42,559,790, while states like Delaware and Vermont show
                    minimal
                    delays.
                    <br>The flight delays over time depict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a noticeable
                    decline in 2020 and a subsequent increase in 2021 and 2022 as air travel resumed. Reasons for
                    flight
                    delays highlight carrier and late aircraft delays as prominent contributors, with fluctuations
                    in
                    weather and National Aviation System delays. Notably, the average carrier delay minutes declined
                    in
                    2020, reflecting the pandemic's influence, but increased in 2021 and 2022 as travel demand
                    rebounded. Overall, the dashboard offers a detailed perspective on airline operational
                    performance,
                    regional variations in delays, temporal trends, and the factors influencing flight delays in the
                    United States.

                    <p>Focusing on weather delays that are largely uncontrollable by the aircraft carriers, we can
                        observe that majority of the airline carrier fall within a range of 0 to 10,000 minutes of
                        delays a month, with a couple of the airlines displaying out of the norm delays from 18,000
                        to
                        28,000 minutes of delays a month. One relationship we can observe from this bubble chart is
                        that
                        as the number of delays increases, the longer the delays, in minutes, for that month. We can
                        also observe that those with the higher number of delays tend to belong to the same group of
                        airlines throughout the years. It is interesting to note that majority of the airlines were
                        able
                        to keep the number of delays, due to weather, at largely within the same range of one
                        another,
                        suggesting that they could have better planning compared to the carriers with constant large
                        number of delays, or are located in locations with generally favourable weather conditions.

            <p>
                Based on our observation on the visualizations, our team identified the following potential
                opportunities
                for the aviation industry to improve their offerings and optimize future investment on services that
                has
                the
                greater impact on travellers’ experience and satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Increase effort on maintenance and offerings for economy class flights during June and July period.
                We
                observed that during this period every year, there is a substantial increase in the number of
                economy
                class
                flights being sold by the airlines. From another visualization on travellers’ satisfaction, the team
                noted
                that travellers are least satisfied on short and medium haul economy class flights. With more
                travellers
                during the June and July period, if airlines improve their economy class offerings and quality
                during
                these
                periods, they can greatly improve a large number of travellers’ experience and vastly improve their
                overall
                ratings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create family packages for flights to popular destinations during the June to July period. We
                observed
                that
                during these periods, in addition to the increase in the number of economy class flights, the
                visualizations
                also indicated a substantial increase in family travellers during this period. By offering dedicated
                family
                packages, the airlines can simplify the booking process and also gain better control over
                standardizing
                in-flight services and amenities. This approach minimizes the need for individualized requests, thus
                enhancing efficiency and enabling airlines to provide a consistent, high-quality travel experience
                for
                the
                families.
